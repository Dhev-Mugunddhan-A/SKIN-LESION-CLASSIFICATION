## Methodologies

The project adopted a comprehensive methodology to tackle the skin lesion classification task and its associated challenges. The overall data pipeline involves separate processing streams for image and metadata before fusion for classification.

Key methodologies employed include:

*   **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
    *   Handling **missing data** using strategies like Iterative Imputer and KNN Imputer.
    *   **Image Preprocessing** including decoding, resizing, augmentation (random flip, brightness, contrast), and normalization. Images were resized to various dimensions, including 224x224 and 128x128.
    *   **Feature Engineering** on metadata, including age binning, one-hot encoding for categorical features, and feature hashing for high-cardinality features.
    *   **Class Imbalance Handling** using techniques such as class weighting, oversampling (RandomOverSampler, SMOTETomek), and undersampling (RandomUnderSampler). Stratified splitting was used to maintain class distribution and avoid data leakage based on patient IDs.
*   **Image Segmentation**: Used **DeepLabv3+** for lesion segmentation, which helps improve classification accuracy and interpretability by localizing pathological regions.
*   **Feature Selection and Engineering**: Transformed and engineered metadata into a machine-readable format for integration with visual data.
*   **Model Architectures**: Explored various state-of-the-art models:
    *   **CNN-Based Models**: ResNet (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ResNet-152, ResNetV2-50), DenseNet (DenseNet-169). Often used as backbones in multimodal models.
    *   **Transformer-Based Methods**: Vision Transformers (ViT), MedMamba, MobileViT. MobileViT and MedMamba architectures were adapted for 2D medical images.
    *   **Multimodal Models**: Architectures that combined image features (from CNN or Transformer backbones) and tabular metadata through concatenation and dense layers.
    *   **Tree-Based Models**: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost. Used on metadata features. Ensemble techniques, including stacking, were explored.
*   **Training and Optimization**:
    *   **Optimizers**: Adam, Nadam, AdamW.
    *   **Loss Functions**: Binary Crossentropy, Squared Hinge, Binary Focal Crossentropy, CrossEntropyLoss (for models using PyTorch). Focal Loss and Binary Focal Crossentropy with class balancing were particularly used to mitigate the class imbalance issue.
    *   **Training Strategies**: Learning rate schedules (Piecewise Constant Decay), Callbacks such as EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, and ModelCheckpoint. Class weights were applied during training.
*   **Model Evaluation**: Performance was evaluated using metrics like AUC (Area Under the Curve), particularly pAUC (partial AUC) with ROC and Precision-Recall curves, Accuracy, and LogLoss.

## Results and Findings

The experimentation phase involved evaluating various modeling strategies on both unimodal (image or metadata only) and multimodal data.

Key findings include:

*   Multimodal approaches, integrating both image data and patient metadata, consistently demonstrated **superior performance** compared to image-only or metadata-only models. This highlights the value of combining diverse information sources for improved diagnostic accuracy.
*   The use of **ensemble learning techniques further improved performance**, reducing variance and increasing robustness.
*   Appropriate **data preprocessing techniques**, especially handling class imbalance and missing values, were crucial for building effective models.
*   Refining lesion segmentation was identified as a way to enhance classification accuracy.
*   Selecting **appropriate base architectures** (such as DenseNet or ViT/MedMamba) and carefully optimizing model complexity are key factors in developing effective diagnostic tools.

These findings suggest that integrating multimodal data and employing ensemble techniques are promising directions for improving AI-driven dermatological diagnosis.

## How to Reproduce or Use the Repository

The repository is organized into `PHASE 1` and `PHASE 2` directories, reflecting the project's progression. The `PHASE 2` folder contains the core components related to the deep learning classification work.


To use this repository:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dhev-Mugunddhan-A/skin-lesion-categorization.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the `PHASE 2` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd PHASE2\
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:** You will need Python and relevant libraries for deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch), data processing (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn), image handling (opencv, PIL), and potentially Streamlit.
4.  **Run the notebooks:** Explore the `.ipynb` files in the `Code files` directory to understand the data preprocessing, model implementations (CNN, ViT, MedMamba, MobileViT, Tree-based), training procedures, and evaluation.
5.  **Run the Streamlit web application:** Navigate to the `streamlit webapp` directory and run the application using Streamlit. It likely provides a user interface to test the trained models.
    ```bash
    cd streamlit\ webapp
    streamlit run app.py 
    ```
    The web application includes saved model files (`best_model_mobilevit_v4.keras`, `fusion_model.pth`) which are used for making predictions.

The `Phase_II project report vfinal.pdf` and `Skin lesion classification methodologies and workflow v 3.pdf` documents provide detailed descriptions of the methods, experiments, and results.
